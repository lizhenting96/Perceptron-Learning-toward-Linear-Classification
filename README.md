# Perceptron-Learning-toward-Linear-Classification
linear perceptron, gradient descent, linear separability

Linear perceptron is a direct method to obtain the complete linear discriminant function g(x). 
It is used to classify a group of samples with d dimensional characteristics into two classes: w1 and w2, that is to say, to find the hyperplane which can separate the two kinds of sample points. 
In this experiment, the perceptron criterion function and gradient descent method are used to classify the linear separable sample set. 
A linear separable sample set is generated randomly, and then the relationship between the adjustment step size and the distance between the two kinds of data, the number of iterations and the adjustment step size is discussed.

This programme runs in the environment of MATLAB. 
The function will generate samples of two classes that are linearly separable and 50 samples for each. Using the method of Linear Perceptron, the programme will find the line which separates the two classes.
This function requires one input and gives one output. The only input variable is the distance of the two classes, and the only output value is the number of iterations. Moreover, the programme will also show the result of classification in the form of figure.
